This is the Assets for my game Vector Warden. 

Vector Warden is a top down 2d rougelite. As the player kills enemies during the game, they level up and get the opportunity to select cards that will give bonuses and benefits during that run. After the player dies, they will have the opportunity to improve their stats in various ways and unlock new cards in order to get farther the next time.
